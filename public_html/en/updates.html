                    <p>The trip around 8 bit microcomputers is complete with this Dead End_ conversion for the Commodore 64.</p>
                    <p>Fede has nearly given up but, at least, has managed to develop a version pretty similar to the rest, taking into account the differences between this platform and previous works.</p>
                    <p>With this launch we have covered the main platforms (ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX and Commodore 64) that ruled our homes in the 80's.</p>

                    <p>We keep on fire launching versions of our most successful multiplatform game so far. This time, the japanese standard has been the chosen one.</p>
                    <p>You can blame Fede as the responsible of this port, assisted by our usual suspects Miguel and Javi &mdash;although the irreverent artist said that MSX users could cope with the same ZX Spectrum graphics, like in the 80's&mdash; and with the great help of the guru <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_cortazar">Jon Cort√°zar</a>, who taught us everything we needed to know about MSX Mode 1.</p>
                    <p>As always, the game in its different formats (tape, disc or cartridge) and source code can be downloaded from its <a href="msx-dead-end_.html">page</a>.</p>

                    <p>Directly from our brand new "crappyports" department, we proudly present Dead End_ for Amstrad CPC. It is the first time we are porting a version of one of our games to any other platform&mdash;remember that Adrian Smethurst ported Sokoban to an arcade board to be playable in MAME.</p>
                    <p>It is also the first time we launch any game for a 8 bit platform appart from ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC in this case.</p>
                    <p>Fede has been in charge of carrying out this version, with Javi's graphic design supervision, Miguel doing some tests (he is the only one from the team able to beat levels 2 to 10) and the priceless help of <a href="https://twitter.com/frangallegobr">Fran Gallego</a>; we would still be hunting that Locomotive BASIC 1.0 bug without his knowledge and advice.</p>

                    <p>The truth is that, rather than an interview, it was a warm chat between friends. Setting aside the cobwebs of our memories, we travelled the history of Compiler Software and, by extension, the group of people that worked together in such interesting projects as developing videogames, publishing a magazine (<a href="http://magazinezx.speccy.org/">MagazineZX</a>) and hosting so many interesing webs related to the ZX Spectrum in our website <a href="http://www.speccy.org/">speccy.org</a>.</p>
                    <p>We wish to thank so much <a href="http://elmundodelspectrum.com">EMS</a> for remembering us but, above all, for their divulgative work about our favourite computer and their podcast, always full of interesting contents to listen.</p>
                    <p>Here is a excerpt of the program with the interview but, please, do not miss the chance of <a href="http://www.ivoox.com/4x07-alberto-gonzalez-mcalby-compiler-spectrum-audios-mp3_rf_11934029_1.html">listening the complete show</a>. Among other topics, there is an interview with a true important character like <a href="https://soundcloud.com/joemcalby">Alberto Gonz√°lez (McAlby)</a>. We were just the opening act.</p>

                <p class="post-meta" itemprop="date" datetime="2015-12-12">12 December 2015</p>
                <div class="post-body">
                    <p>During past september we got an email from Adrian Smethurst (cmonkey) hiding one of the biggest surprised we have received since many years. It happens that good fellow Adrian started working on the source code of Sokoban and ended porting it to <a href="http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=654">Taito L System</a> arcade board. That name may tell you nothing, as it didn't to us, but we are sure that you may know some titles running on it, as <a href="http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9046">Plotting</a>, <a href="http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9180">Puzznic</a>, <a href="http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9254">Raimais</a> or <a href="http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7785">Fighting Hawk</a>.</p>
                    <p>Of course, it is the first time that a Compiler Software game runs on such an exotic hardware. You can't imagine how proud we are of having our game in <a href="http://mamedev.org/">MAME</a>, even considering that we were not involved in the development. It is kind of funny that this game has followed that "reversed path", compared to those 80's classics trying to bring the arcade sensations to our home microcomputers.</p>

This contest was organized by <a href="http://www.retroaccion.org/">RetroAcci√≥n (Spanish)</a> as part of <a href="http://www.retroaccion.org/retromania-2015">RetroMa√±√≠a 2015 (Spanish)</a> event and the main subject was the galactic saga whose seventh chapter will be released in less than a month.</p>
                    <p>Using our recently purchased <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/studio/buy">GameMaker: Studio</a> Professional license, thanks to <a href="https://www.yoyogames.com/news/261">Humble Bundle deals</a>, our pal Miguel has started learning it and, as an excuse, has built this little game and has sent it to the contest. Not only has he earned a bunch of experience points as "Game Maker", but also Estar Guars has reached a remarkable second position.</p>

                    <p>We have been reported a bug in Sokoban. It prevents level 24 to be resolved. So we have fixed the problem and replaced downloadable files with new ones.</p>

                    <p>Today we are presenting a couple of things we have recently done, so you can be busy while waiting for what it is yet to come.</p>
                    <p>At last MadriSX & Retro 2006 meeting we presented <a href="spectrum-revelados.html">"Revelados"</a>, a little program based on <a href="http://www.eximeno.com/" target="_blank">Santiago Eximeno</a>' texts. It is not properly a game, but if you like this author's micro-tales you will surely interested. We are releasing not only the game but also the source code, very simple, that you can use as a text reader, and a cover just in case you want to record your own physical cassette tape.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, we bring you a DSK format compilation, named <a href="spectrum-pack-ferpecto.html">"Pack Ferpecto"</a>, containing every single title we have published so far, with a friendly loading menu so you can access to all games in an easy way.</p>
                    <p>Games included are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Another brick on the wall 2.</li>
                        <li>ZX Columns.</li>
                        <li>ZX Mines.</li>
                        <li>ZX Mines 2.</li>
                        <li>ZX Poker.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>With this compilation, it will be much easy to save it in a physical format, may be in a 3" or 3.5" floppy disk, maybe in a compact flash card, and enjoy them in the real hardware.</p>
                    <p>That's all for now. As a famous philosopher said. "all the iceberg is above the water", that's it? or maybe not? :-)</p>
                    <p>Stay tuned to your screens. More news soon.</p>

                    <p>Hello again.</p>
                    <p>As today we present three brand new games at MadriSX & Retro 2005, we've redesigned or web site. And a nice way to put on the page is to bring you launch these three new games, all for Sinclair ZX Spectrum microcomputer.</p>
                    <p>First of all, a puzzle game based on SEGA Classic: <strong>ZX Columns</strong>; program by Santiago Romero and graphics by Davit Masia.</p>
                    <p>Following with a version of famous Breakout: <strong>Another Brick On The Wall 2</strong>, a remake of the game presented to 2004 BASIC Contest at Bytemaniacos, winner of its cathegory. This game has been created by Miguel A. Garc√≠a Prada with a loading screen by Davit Masia.</p>
                    <p>And at last but not at least, we have a board game, <strong>ZX Poker</strong>, based on Solitaire Poker, a card game very addictive programmed by Santiago Romero.</p>
                    <p>Every game has its own printable cassette inlay, if you want to print it and save the games on a cassette tape, and also has instructions and loading screens.</p>
                    <p>We hope you will enjoy playing them so much as we have enjoyed making them.</p>
